# Udacity Course: Intro to Machine Learning

The online course is located here: <https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud120>

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook `Udacity-ML_Intro.ipynb` which was used as a playground along the course to solve the quizzes and several exercises.
The Udacity repository `ud120-projects` was included as a submodule and contains coding exercises, mini-projects and the final project.
